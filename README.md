json-editor-customization-textarea-as-positive-number-array
============================================================

This is an example of customizing an implementation of [json-editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) in a minimal web page, to 
use a textarea for requesting an array of positive numbers from the user.  The necessary hooks are made to the editor to sanitize user input
and return it as an array instead of a string.

I am not very familiar with the internals of the json-editor library and am posting this mainly for my own future reference and to allow for review and improvement.

Pull requests and comments are welcomed from developers more familiar with json-editor and who have ideas for improvment of this example.
